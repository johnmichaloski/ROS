  \b Go Math Representations

  Positions are vectors that indicate where something is. In the
  three-dimensional world, three numbers are necessary to indicate
  position. Go Motion supports position vectors in several
  representations: Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical. 

  The Cartesian representation uses three numbers \b x, \b y and \b z to
  represent distances from the origin along three perpendicular
  axes. The cylindrical representation uses three numbers \b r, \b theta
  and \b z to represent radial distance away from the origin, angle
  around the origin and distance up and down from the origin
  respectively. The spherical representation uses three numbers
  \b theta, \b phi and \b r to represent angle down from the zenith,
  angle around the origin and radius from the origin respectively. Go
  Motion has functions that convert position in one representation
  position in another representation, so the choice of which
  representation to use can be made for convenience. Cartesian
  representations will be assumed unless otherwise specified.

  Orientations are vectors that indicate how something is rotated. In
  the three-dimensional world, three numbers are necessary to indicate
  orientation. Go Motion supports orientation vectors in several
  representations: roll, pitch and yaw; Euler angles; quaternions;
  rotation vectors and rotation matrices. Some of these
  representations use more than three numbers, exploiting redundancy
  to make calculations with these representations more efficient. For
  example, a quaternion uses four numbers, and a rotation matrix uses
  nine numbers. 

  Vectors are usually written as a column of numbers enclosed in
  vertical bars, like this:

  | 1 | <br>
  | 2 | - a vector depicted in its column form <br>
  | 3 |

  This can be unwieldy in text documentation, so vectors may also be
  written as a row of numbers enclosed in parentheses, like this:

  ( 1 2 3 ) - a vector depicted in its row form

  The interpretation of a vector depends on the quantity it
  represents. The vector shown above could mean a translation of 1, 2
  and 3 units in the x, y and z directions if the vector were a
  Cartesian position, or a rotation of 1, 2 and 3 units around the x,
  y and z directions if the vector were an orientation in roll, pitch
  and yaw. 

  Both position and orientation are needed to fully describe where
  something is and how it is rotated. The combination of position and
  orientation is called a 'pose'. Poses can be shown in row
  form like this pose representing a Cartesian position of ( 1 2 3 )
  and an orientation in roll, pitch and yaw of ( 30 -30 90 ):

  ( 1 2 3 ; 30 -30 90)

  A semicolon is used to separate the position from the orientation.

  <b>Go Math Reference Frames</b>

  Regardless of the representation chosen, the numbers that indicate
  position and orientation of an object depend on the established
  origin. Several origins may be established for convenience, for
  example one fixed on the world and one that moves with a tool. These
  origins may differ from each other in both position and
  orientation. The establishment of the position and orientation of an
  origin is a 'reference frame'. The term 'coordinate frame' is used
  interchangeably with 'reference frame'.

  When several reference frames are being used, they are denoted as
  identifiers in braces, for example,

  {A} - a reference frame called 'A'.

  {world} - the world reference frame.

  {tool} - the world reference frame.

  To convert the representation of a pose in one reference frame to
  its representation in another, one needs to know the position and
  orientation of one origin with respect to the other. This difference
  between the two origins is called a 'transform'.

  Poses and transforms are similar things; both include position
  and orientation. Whether something is a pose or a transform depends
  on how one is using it. Poses are used to indicate the position and
  orientation of things with respect to an established reference
  frame. Transforms are used to indicate the position and orientation
  of reference frames with respect to other reference frames. If a
  'thing' happens to be a reference frame, its pose is its transform.

  \b Go Math Nomenclature

  The letter \b P is used to denote positions and the letter \b R is
  used to denote orientations. As usual, trailing subscripts denote
  the identity of quantities, for example,

  P<small><sub>hand</sub></small> - the position of the hand.

  R<small><sub>head</sub></small> - the orientation of the head.

  Leading superscripts denote the reference frame in which the
  quantity is expressed, for example,

  <small><sup>A</sup></small>P<small><sub>hand</sub></small> - the
  position of the hand with respect to the {A} reference frame.

  <small><sup>B</sup></small>R<small><sub>head</sub></small> - the
  orientation of the head with respect to the {B} reference frame.

  The figure below shows a rotation of reference frame {B} 
  with respect to reference frame {A} by an angle \b u. Note that the
  rotation can be viewed as a rotation of {B} with respect to {A},
  denoted
  <small><sup>A</sup></small>u<small><sub>B</sub></small>,
  or as a rotation of {A} with respect to {B}, denoted 
  <small><sup>B</sup></small>u<small><sub>A</sub></small>. The heads
  of arrows are attached to the 'of the' frames, while the tails of
  arrows are based on the 'with respect to' frames. Angles are
  taken as positive according the the right hand rule, so in this
  figure <small><sup>A</sup></small>u<small><sub>B</sub></small> is a
  positive number of about 45 degrees, while
  <small><sup>B</sup></small>u<small><sub>A</sub></small> is a
  negative number of the same magnitude. 

  \image html fig002.png
  <center> \e Figure 1. </center>

  Transforms from one reference frame to another are denoted with
  leading subscripts and superscripts. The leading subscript denotes
  the original frame, and the leading superscript denotes the new
  frame. If a transform is purely rotation, it is denoted with an
  \b R, for example,

  <small><sup>B</sup><sub>A</sub></small>R - a rotation from the {A}
  frame to the {B} frame.

  If a transform includes both a rotation and a translation, it is
  denoted with a \b T, for example,

  <small><sup>world</sup><sub>tool</sub></small>T - a transform from the {tool}
  frame to the {world} frame.

  To convert a quantity from one frame to another, pre-multiply the
  quantity by the transform. Algebraically, the leading subscript of
  the transform must match the leading superscript of the quantity,
  for example,
  
  <small><sup>B</sup></small>P = <small><sup>B</sup><sub>A</sub></small>R * <small><sup>A</sup></small>P
  
  This is read, 'the position with respect to the B frame is the
  rotation from the A frame to the B frame times the position with
  respect to the A frame.' Another example is,
  
  <small><sup>world</sup></small>P = <small><sup>world</sup><sub>tool</sub></small>T * <small><sup>tool</sup></small>P
  
  This is read, 'the position with respect to the world frame is the
  transform from the tool frame to the world frame times the position with
  respect to the tool frame.'

  One can generate a rotational transform by defining an orientation
  vector with the appropriate angles. If using a roll, pitch and yaw
  representation, the rotational transforms in the figure above (each about
  the \b z axis) is a yaw:

  | &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; | <br>
  | &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; | = <small><sup>A</sup></small>R<small><sub>B</sub></small> <br>
  | <small><sup>A</sup></small>u<small><sub>B</sub></small> |

  | &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; | <br>
  | &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; | = <small><sup>B</sup></small>R<small><sub>A</sub></small> <br>
  | <small><sup>B</sup></small>u<small><sub>A</sub></small> |

  and negative angles work as well, for

  | &nbsp;&nbsp; 0 &nbsp; | <br>
  | &nbsp;&nbsp; 0 &nbsp; | = <small><sup>A</sup></small>R<small><sub>B</sub></small> <br>
  | -<small><sup>B</sup></small>u<small><sub>A</sub></small> |

  \b Go Math Examples
  
  Given a reference frame {B} rotated 30 degrees with respect to the \b
  z axis of reference frame {A}, as in Figure 1 above, transform
  from points in the {B} frame to points in the {A} frame like this:
  \code
  go_rpy rot;
  go_cart pt_in_b;
  go_cart pt_in_a;

  // The angle of {B} with respect to {A} is 30 degrees.
  // Go uses angles in radians.
  rot.r = 0, rot.p = 0, rot.y = GO_TO_RAD(30);

  pt_in_b.x = 1, pt_in_b.y = 2, pt_in_b.z = 3;

  // Multiply a transform and a point to get a new point.
  go_rpy_cart_mult(&rot, &pt_in_b, &pt_in_a);

  go_cart_print(&pt_in_a);
  \endcode
  will print the postion of the point in the {A} frame: 
  \code
  -0.133975 2.232051 3.000000
  \endcode
  Here is a more complex example of a full transform, including both
  translation and rotation.
  \image html fig003.png
  <center>\e Figure 2.</center>

  The frame {B} is translated and rotated with respect to {A}.
  <sup><small>A</small></sup>x<sub><small>B</small></sub> is the
  amount of translation of {B} in the \b x direction of {A}.
  Likewise, <sup><small>A</small></sup>y<sub><small>B</small></sub> is the
  amount of translation of {B} in the \b y direction of {A}.
  <sup><small>A</small></sup>u<sub><small>B</small></sub> is the
  rotation of the {B} frame about the \b z axis of the {A} frame.

  To convert points in the {B} frame to points in the {A} frame, do
  this: 
  \code
  go_pose pose;
  go_rpy rot;
  go_cart pt_in_b;
  go_cart pt_in_a;

  // The translation of {B} with respect to {A} is about (2 1 0).
  pose.tran.x = 2, pose.tran.y = 1, pose.tran.z = 0;

  // The angle of {B} wrt {A} is about 30 degrees, made into radians.
  rot.r = 0, rot.p = 0, rot.y = GO_TO_RAD(30);

  // A 'go_pose' uses quaternions for rotations, so we have to
  // convert a roll-pitch-yaw to a quaternion.
  go_rpy_quat_convert(&rot, &pose.rot);

  pt_in_b.x = 1, pt_in_b.y = 2, pt_in_b.z = 3;

  // Multiply a transform and a point to get a new point.
  go_pose_cart_mult(&pose, &pt_in_b, &pt_in_a);

  go_cart_print(&pt_in_a);

  \endcode
  This gives the transformed point in the {A} frame as
  \code
  1.866025 3.232051 3.000000
  \endcode
